# Partydeck - A cool online card game

The `Partydeck` app contains 3 microservices, all connected:

- **The live `server`**, responsible for creating live games, shuffling the cards and generating game codes. Powered by Java and the Spring framework.
- **The live `game`**, the Front-End `React.js` app that connects to the live server.
- **The game `panel`**, a traditional MERN application to store and manage decks.
