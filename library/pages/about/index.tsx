          <p>When we thought of Partydeck, we wanted a game that is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Playable from distance</li>
            <li>
              Inclusive and fair - the game makes the judge or the round judge.
            </li>
            <li>
              based on the quality of the answer card rather than the quality of
              the player who had it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Binding - itâ€™s impossible to win when you are not 100% focused
            </li>
            <li>
              Personalized - each one can make their own customized version
            </li>
            <li>
              Connecting - the game makes you get to know the other players
              better
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ContentSection>

          <p>
            Developing an application takes time and patience, and the result is
            not always perfect.
